This is music123 version 8 ('less' versioning system).

music123's goal in life is simple. With just mpg123 or ogg123, there
was no way to randomly play a mixed batch of ogg's and mp3's.  If
you fed the wrong file to the wrong player, it would crash.

xmms could randomly play mixed ogg's and mp3's, but I'm frequently
not in X. I'm sure there's some ncurses solution out there, but I
like the mpg123/ogg123 interface - I just want something that can
handle mixed collections of files. So I wrote music123.

music123 has a similar interface to mpg123 and ogg123. It'll play
any type of file listed in its config file, the first found of
~/.music123 or /etc/music123rc. The default config file includes
lines for mp3, ogg, and wav.

ogg123, by default, has the default device set to /dev/null. Since
music123 normally uses the default device of ogg123, it won't play
ogg files if you haven't changed that option. Fixes include editing
/etc/libao.conf to change the default device of ogg123, or change
the ogg123 line in /etc/music123rc to include a device option for
ogg123 in the quotes. 

The half-second pause between songs is deliberate, so music123 can
be killed by Control-C. Note that it can be removed with the -D
option, or changed by -d.

If anyone has added stuff to /etc/music123rc, I'd like to see it so
I can add it into the master file (probably commented out).
