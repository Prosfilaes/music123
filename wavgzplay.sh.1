.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wavgzplay.sh file.wav.gz
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B wavgzplay.sh
command.
.PP
\fBwavgzplay.sh\fP is a gzipped wave file player. It unzips a wav.gz file
and feeds the wav file to music123. A terribly simple script.
.SH OPTIONS
There are no options.
.SH BUGS
Certain file names with ' " ` and probably other characters in them won't work, and you can probably run
arbitrary code with the right filenames. That's why this is in examples rather than /usr/bin.
