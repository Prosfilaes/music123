music123 (10) unstable; urgency=low

  * The lost actress release.
  * The conffile had some entries with mixed case and some only
    in lower case. Changed all to include upper, title and lower
    case. Note this is a conffile change, and the program only
    recognizes the exact case given in the conffile. (Closes: #191741)
  * Update policy version and Build-Depends.
  * Upstream Author(s) is a compromise decision of the upstream 
    author(s).

  * The lonely male geek release.
  * The version of GNAT changed, meaning the soname of libgnat changed.

    have the problem.
