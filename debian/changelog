music123 (15) unstable; urgency=low
  * The "Oh, that's what cutting edge means" release
  * GCC-3.3 miscompiles music123 on AMD64; this update
    encapsulates one line in a procedure to avoid that
    compiler bug.
  * Depend on gnat-3.4 | gnat-3.3 | gnat, since that 
    should work now.

music123 (14) unstable; urgency=low
  * The lovely lace release.
  * Added AMD64 to the architecture list. (Closes: #251586)
  * Add a comment about playing files with mplayer.
  * Except for the version number, the code and resulting assembly 
    (on ix86) is unchanged.

music123 (13) unstable; urgency=low
  * Light a candle release
  * Note that recent versions of vorbis-tools support Ogg Flac
    and Ogg Speex, too, and suggest them.
  * Add a note in README about music123 not handling sound; look in 
    ogg123 and mpg123 if the sound doesn't play. (Closes: #211917)
  * Fix the randomization function to use the algorithm from
    Knuth; I don't know that it works any better, but the placebo
    effect should work for, not against this one. (Closes: #184537)

music123 (12) unstable; urgency=low
  * Delete mips/mipsel from the architecture list, as
    gnat-* doesn't seem to exists over there.
  * Also remove gnat3.2 from build-depends.

music123 (11) unstable; urgency=low

music123 (10) unstable; urgency=low

  * The lost actress release.
  * The conffile had some entries with mixed case and some only
    in lower case. Changed all to include upper, title and lower
    case. Note this is a conffile change, and the program only
    recognizes the exact case given in the conffile. (Closes: #191741)
  * Update policy version and Build-Depends.
  * Upstream Author(s) is a compromise decision of the upstream 
    author(s).

    Joost van Baal.

    and a hundred line manpage, both of which can be translated. Please
    help.

music123 (7) unstable; urgency=low
   
  * The lonely male geek release.

    have the problem.
